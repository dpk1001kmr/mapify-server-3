// Learn about TDD (Test driven developement)

//-------------------------------------
// Validation while uploading the file
//-------------------------------------
- check for all headers in all the sheets (total should be 11 fields)
- check if any header field is missing (total should be 11 fields in the header)
- check if extra header is present (total should be 11 fields in the header)


//-------------------------------------
// Validation while saving the file
//-------------------------------------
- check if a two file fields are mapped to same database field (don't save in this case)
- check if any null value is present then skip the saving for that row (all fields are required)

- make popup litte small
- user should be able to save partial mapped excel sheet
- mask the database fields into json document and define field level properties.
- {
  dbfieldname: [firstName, lastName, email, phone, jobTitle, department, company, street, zipCode, city, country]
  maskedfieldname: [First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Job Title, Department, Company, Street, Zip Code, City, Country]
  mandatoryfield: [ First Name, Email, Phone, Country]
  validation: [First Name, Email, Phone, Country]
}
